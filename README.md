Exploring Data Aggregation Across Diverse Frameworks
Welcome to my GitHub repository, where you'll find the code and insights from my latest project – a comprehensive exploration into the world of data aggregation using multiple frameworks. This project, which I've documented in detail on my .dev blog, aims to shed light on the performance, scalability, and usability of different data processing tools in handling complex, distributed test data.

About the Project
In this endeavor, I've embarked on a two-fold journey:

Generating Distributed Test Data: I've developed a program that allows users to create test data with specific parameters:

Number of files
File format (Excel, CSV, XLSB)
Data type distribution (Integers, Strings, Dates)
This process not only simulates real-world data complexities but also provides a versatile dataset for our aggregation experiments.

Aggregating Data Using Various Frameworks: The project utilizes four distinct frameworks – Pandas, Scikit-learn, Polar, and Dask – to aggregate the generated data. I've conducted a thorough analysis, focusing on:

Append operations (combining records from multiple files)
Add operations (summing records across datasets)
Each framework was evaluated based on execution time, memory usage, scalability, data integrity, and more, offering a nuanced view of their capabilities in different scenarios.

Insights and Findings
The project reveals intriguing insights about each framework's strengths and weaknesses, providing valuable guidance for anyone working with large and diverse datasets. Whether you're a data scientist, a software engineer, or just a data enthusiast, you'll find the findings from this project enlightening and potentially influential in your choice of data processing tools.
